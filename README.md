Rocket Ballistic Trajectory Simulation in Python

To create a Python script that generates a simulation of a rocket's ballistic trajectory, you can use the following steps:

Define the initial conditions of the rocket (such as initial velocity, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration).
Calculate the x and y position of the rocket at each time step using projectile motion equations.
Plot the trajectory of the rocket using a graphing library like Matplotlib.
Here is an example Python script that simulates the ballistic trajectory of a rocket:
